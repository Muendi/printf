0x10.c - printf

DESCRIPTION

This is the first team project in the ALXSE - Holberton program.
_printf replicates the C standard library printf() function.

AIMS OF THE PROJECT

How to use git in a team setting

Applying variadic functions to a big project

The complexities of printf

Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow

PROTOTYPE

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

USAGE

Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format

All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c

Returns the number of characters in the ouput string on success, -1 otherwise

Call it this way: _printf("format string", arguments...) where format string can contain conversion specifiers and flags, along with regular characters

EXAMPLES

_printf("Hello, Main\n") prints "Hello, Main", followed by a new line

_printf("%s", "Hello") prints "Hello"

_printf("This is a number: %d", 98) prints "This is a number: 98"

TASKS

These are the tasks of this project

0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life

1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't

2. Just because it's print doesn't mean it's the gospel

3. With a face like mine, I do better in print

4. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print

5. Nothing in fine print is ever good news

6. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print

7. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journaliss and believe these lies when they see them in fine print

8. The big print gives and the small print takes away

9. Sarcasm is not lost in print

10. Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests

11. The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the perfomance

12. It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print

13. Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print what ever, suddenly I would see a collection

14. Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party

15. The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping raher than savoring

16. All the above options work well together
